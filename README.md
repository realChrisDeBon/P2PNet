### About

P2PNet facilitates peer-to-peer networking with an array of components for setting up your network. Initial peer discovery can be initiated in the LAN, and facilitated over a WAN utilizing various methods such as bootstrapping and IPv6 ICMP blasting. The PeerNetwork will be able to use a range of interoperable WAN and LAN discovery mechanisms to expand and grow the network, manage peer connections, and distribute data and information. Implementing the P2PNet library will make implementing peer-to-peer functionality in your application more seamless and integrated.

*Please note this repo is still under development. Many features are working as described, with the grander interoperability still being rolled out.*
