    "summary": "Xterm.js is a front-end component written in TypeScript that lets applications bring fully-featured terminals to their users in the browser. It's used by popular projects such as VS Code, Hyper and Theia. Features Terminal apps just work: Xterm.js works with most terminal apps such as bash, vim, and tmux, including support for curses-based apps and mouse events. Performant: Xterm.js is really fast, it even includes a GPU-accelerated renderer. Rich Unicode support: Supports CJK, emojis, and IMEs. Self-contained: Requires zero dependencies to work. Accessible: Screen reader and minimum contrast ratio support can be turned on. And much more: Links, theming, addons, well documented API, etc. What xterm.js is not Xterm.js is not a terminal application that you can download and use on your computer. Xterm.js is not bash. Xterm.js can be connected to processes like bash and let you interact with them (provide input, receive output). Getting Started First, you need to install the module, we ship exclusively through npm, so you need that installed and then add xterm.js as a dependency by running: npm install xterm To start using xterm.js on your browser, add the xterm.js and xterm.css to the head of your HTML page. Then create a <div id=\"terminal\"></div> onto which xterm can attach itself. Finally, instantiate the Terminal object and then call the open function with the DOM object of the div. <!doctype html> <html> <head> <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"node_modules/xterm/css/xterm.css\" /> <script src=\"node_modules/xterm/lib/xterm.js\"></script> </head> <body> <div id=\"terminal\"></div> <script> var term = new Terminal(); term.open(document.getElementById('terminal')); term.write('Hello from \\x1B[1;3;31mxterm.js\\x1B[0m $ ') </script> </body> </html> Importing The recommended way to load xterm.js is via the ES6 module syntax: import { Terminal } from 'xterm'; Addons ⚠️ This section describes the new addon format introduced in v3.14.0, see here for the instructions on the old format Addons are separate modules that extend the Terminal by building on the xterm.js API. To use an addon, you first need to install it in your project: npm i -S xterm-addon-web-links Then import the addon, instantiate it and call Terminal.loadAddon: import { Terminal } from 'xterm'; import { WebLinksAddon } from 'xterm-addon-web-links'; const terminal = new Terminal(); // Load WebLinksAddon on terminal, this is all that's needed to get web links // working in the terminal. terminal.loadAddon(new WebLinksAddon()); The xterm.js team maintains the following addons, but anyone can build them: xterm-addon-attach: Attaches to a server running a process via a websocket xterm-addon-fit: Fits the terminal to the containing element xterm-addon-search: Adds search functionality xterm-addon-web-links: Adds web link detection and interaction Browser Support Since xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Specifically the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. Xterm.js works seamlessly in Electron apps and may even work on earlier versions of the browsers. These are the versions we strive to keep working. Node.js Support We also publish xterm-headless which is a stripped down version of xterm.js that runs in Node.js. An example use case for this is to keep track of a terminal's state where the process is running and using the serialize addon so it can get all state restored upon reconnection. API The full API for xterm.js is contained within the TypeScript declaration file, use the branch/tag picker in GitHub (w) to navigate to the correct version of the API. Note that some APIs are marked experimental, these are added to enable experimentation with new ideas without committing to support it like a normal semver API. Note that these APIs can change radically between versions, so be sure to read release notes if you plan on using experimental APIs. Releases Xterm.js follows a monthly release cycle roughly. All current and past releases are available on this repo's Releases page, you can view the high-level roadmap on the wiki and see what we're working on now by looking through Milestones. Beta builds Our CI releases beta builds to npm for every change that goes into master. Install the latest beta build with: npm install -S xterm@beta These should generally be stable, but some bugs may slip in. We recommend using the beta build primarily to test out new features and to verify bug fixes.

To use an addon, you first need to install it in your project: npm i -S xterm-addon-web-links Then import the addon, instantiate it and call Terminal.loadAddon: import { Terminal } from 'xterm'; import { WebLinksAddon } from 'xterm-addon-web-links'; const terminal = new Terminal(); // Load WebLinksAddon on terminal, this is all that's needed to get web links // working in the terminal. terminal.loadAddon(new WebLinksAddon()); The xterm.js team maintains the following addons, but anyone can build them: xterm-addon-attach: Attaches to a server running a process via a websocket xterm-addon-fit: Fits the terminal to the containing element xterm-addon-search: Adds search functionality xterm-addon-web-links: Adds web link detection and interaction Browser Support Since xterm.js is typically implemented as a developer tool, only modern browsers are supported officially. Specifically the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari. Xterm.js works seamlessly in Electron apps and may even work on earlier versions of the browsers. These are the versions we strive to keep working. Node.js Support We also publish xterm-headless which is a stripped down version of xterm.js that runs in Node.js. An example use case for this is to keep track of a terminal's state where the process is running and using the serialize addon so it can get all state restored upon reconnection. API The full API for xterm.js is contained within the TypeScript declaration file, use the branch/tag picker in GitHub (w) to navigate to the correct version of the API. Note that some APIs are marked experimental, these are added to enable experimentation with new ideas without committing to support it like a normal semver API. Note that these APIs can change radically between versions, so be sure to read release notes if you plan on using experimental APIs. Releases Xterm.js follows a monthly release cycle roughly. All current and past releases are available on this repo's Releases page, you can view the high-level roadmap on the wiki and see what we're working on now by looking through Milestones. Beta builds Our CI releases beta builds to npm for every change that goes into master. Install the latest beta build with: npm install -S xterm@beta These should generally be stable, but some bugs may slip in. We recommend using the beta build primarily to test out new features and to verify bug fixes.

    "summary": "Bootstrap \uD83E\uDD1D The application serves as a bootstrap node, providing an HTTP endpoint to distribute known peers to new peers joining the network. This setup ensures seamless peer discovery and initialization, enabling efficient and secure distributed data exchange within the peer network. By containerizing the application using Docker, deployment becomes significantly easier and makes quick VPS deployments easy. Additionally, the user control panel offers finer-grained controls over the network, including scaling and monitoring, which enhances the manageability and reliability of the peer network infrastructure. Initialization The P2PBootstrap project initializes by setting up the necessary configurations and services required for the bootstrap server to operate. The main entry point is the Program.cs file, which configures the application and starts the web server. Configuration: The application reads configuration settings from the appsettings.json file. This includes settings for encryption keys, database paths, and other essential configurations. Logging: Logging is configured to use a plain text format and is activated to capture important events and errors. Web Server Setup: The application uses ASP.NET Core to set up the web server. It configures the HTTP request pipeline, enabling default files, static files, and routing. This is an AOT compatible application, as is most of the P2PNet library. Operation The P2PBootstrap project operates by providing several key functionalities: Peer Distribution: The bootstrap server provides an HTTP endpoint (/api/Bootstrap/peers) to distribute the list of known peers to new peers joining the network. This endpoint can operate in two modes: Trustless Mode: Returns the list of known peers directly. Authority Mode: Requires the client to receive and store a public key from the bootstrap server before returning the peer list. Parser Integration: The server integrates with a parser to handle input and output operations. It provides endpoints to get parser output (/api/parser/output) and to submit parser input (/api/parser/input). Encryption Service: The server initializes an encryption service to handle secure communication. This includes generating and loading PGP keys from the specified directory. Database Initialization: The server initializes a local database to store necessary data. It ensures the database directory exists and sets up the required files. User Control Panel The user control panel provides a web-based interface for managing the bootstrap server. In this web-based interface is a terminal for executing commands. It includes the following pages for easier management as well: Overview: Displays an overview of the server's status and key metrics. Settings: Allows users to modify server settings, such as encryption keys and database paths. Peers: Displays the list of known peers and provides options to perform actions on them, such as disconnecting or blocking peers. Diagrams To supplement the information visually, the following diagrams are provided: Bootstrap Server Architecture: Shows the overall architecture of the bootstrap server, including its interaction with the P2P network and the user control panel. Peer Distribution Flow: Illustrates the flow of peer distribution, from a new peer requesting the peer list to the server returning the list based on the configured trust policy.

    "summary": "P2P Network Basics \uD83C\uDF10 The P2PNet library provides the core functionality for building and managing a peer-to-peer network. It includes classes and methods for peer discovery, connection management, data exchange, and network routines. This document provides a broad overview of the peer network basics. Initialization The PeerNetwork class is the main entry point for initializing and managing the peer-to-peer network. It sets up the necessary configurations and services required for network operations. Configuration: The application reads configuration settings from the provided parameters. This includes settings for designated ports, inbound peer acceptance, and trust policies. Logging: Logging is configured to use a plain text format and is activated to capture important events and errors. Local Address Loading: The application scans all network interface devices and collects essential information needed for the peer network, such as public IP addresses. Operation The PeerNetwork class operates by providing several key functionalities: Peer Discovery and Connection: The peer network supports both LAN and WAN peer discovery. It uses broadcasting and multicasting to discover peers within the network and establishes connections with them. LAN Discovery: The application can broadcast and discover peers within the local network. WAN Discovery: The application can discover peers over the wide area network using designated ports and WAN components. Peer Management: The peer network manages a list of known peers and active peer channels. It supports adding, removing, and elevating peer permissions. Known Peers: A list of peers that have been discovered and are known to the network. Active Peer Channels: A list of active peer channels that are currently connected and exchanging data. Data Exchange: The peer network supports data exchange between peers using peer channels. It handles sending and receiving data, as well as processing incoming packets. Peer Channels: Represents a communication channel between two peers. It handles the sending and receiving of data packets. Routines The NetworkRoutines class provides a mechanism for managing network routines. Routines are tasks that run at specified intervals to perform various network-related operations. Routine Management: The NetworkRoutines class manages a dictionary of routines and provides methods for adding, starting, stopping, and setting the interval of routines. Default Routines: The application initializes with default routines, such as rotating broadcast ports and discerning peer channels. Custom Routines: Users can add custom routines to perform specific tasks. Routines are accessed using their RoutineName property. This is automatically handled when they are added as network routines. Trust Policies The PeerNetwork class includes trust policies for managing incoming peer connections and bootstrap connections. Incoming Peer Trust Policy: Handles trust and permissions for incoming peer connections. It supports different modes for handling inbound peers, such as queue-based and event-based. Bootstrap Trust Policy: Handles trust and permissions for bootstrap connections. It supports different trust policies, such as trustless and authority-based connections. Diagrams To supplement the information visually, the following diagrams are provided: Peer Network Architecture: Shows the overall architecture of the peer network, including its interaction with peers and network routines. Peer Discovery Flow: Illustrates the flow of peer discovery, from broadcasting to establishing connections and managing peer channels."

    "summary": "Peers Peers are representative of client users within the peer network. When a connection is established to a peer through the TCP listener, the connection by default is wrapped in an instance of the GenericPeer implementation of IPeer and the PeerChannel which stores an IPeer implementation. The IPeer interface defines the essential properties and methods for a peer, including the IP address, port, TCP client, network stream, and a unique identifier. The GenericPeer class provides a default implementation of the IPeer interface, encapsulating the peer's IP address, port, TCP client, and network stream. It also includes a unique identifier for the peer, which can be used for whitelisting and blacklisting peers in the network. The PeerChannel class represents a communication channel with a peer in the P2P network. It manages the sending and receiving of data packets, handles connection retries, and maintains the state of the communication channel. The PeerChannel class also includes methods for opening and closing the channel, as well as handling incoming and outgoing data packets. The PacketHandleProtocol class stores the Action delegates for each packet type, and the PeerChannel will invoke these by default depending on the respective data packet type. Peer Lifecycle The lifecycle of a peer in the P2P network begins with the discovery and connection phase. When a new peer is discovered, the handler checks if the peer is a valid connection. If the peer is a new connection and not duplicate, and is also not blocked, it will be wrapped in an instance of the GenericPeer class and depending on the IncomingPeerTrustPolicy.IncomingPeerTrustPolicy value, will be either enqueued and/or passed to the event OnIncomingPeerConnectionAttempt by the InboundConnectingPeersQueue, then finally will be added to the KnownPeers list. Once the connection is established, a PeerChannel is created to manage the communication with the peer. The PeerChannel handles the sending and receiving of data packets, connection retries, and maintains the state of the communication channel. The PeerChannel will then be added to the ActivePeerChannels list. The PeerChannel also invokes the appropriate Action delegates from the PacketHandleProtocol class based on the type of data packet received. This ensures that the correct actions are taken for each type of data packet, facilitating efficient and reliable communication between peers. There are some trust policies under IncomingPeerTrustPolicy that can slighly modify the initial behavior of the established PeerChannel AllowDefaultCommunication - as the name implies, allows default communication between peers to exchange PureMessagePackets and DisconnectPackets. Default is true. AllowEnhancedPacketExchange - determines if peers will be trusted to exchange all other packet types, such as DataTransmissionPackets, which contain binary data such as files and network-related tasks. Default is false. RunDefaultTrustProtocol - determines if, upon opening the peer channel, the default routine IncomingPeerTrustPolicy.DefaultTrustProtocol will be invoked to determine if the peer is a truster member of the network or not If you intend to erect a more secure and private network that will leverage encryption or certificates for identification, you might set AllowDefaultCommunication to true, AllowEnhancedPacketExchange to false, and RunDefaultTrustProtocol to true. You would then devise a multi-step method called PeerTrustHandshake that takes a PeerChannel parameter. For example, the method would exchange a few PureMessagePackets for some kind of handshake, temporarily elevate the trust level of the peer, then swap a DataTransmissionPacket to exchange a key or signed message. Then confirm whether to keep trust elevated, or to demote trust and then proceed to end the connection with the peer. Then you would set the IncomingPeerTrustPolicy.DefaultTrustProtocol delegate to the PeerTrustHandshake you just made. Peer Channel The PeerChannel is a managed wrapper for the connection with the peer. It is designed to handle the inbound and outbound relay of data and information, control accessibility and permissions, and safely handle other network logic. Much of the logic uses delegates in order to remain modular for development needs. This is the list of delegates in the PacketHandleProtocol class that the PeerChannel uses for handling different types of packets. These are all Action< string > delegates, where the string is a JSON serialized form of the packet: Name Description PacketHandleProtocol.HandleIdentityPacketAction The default delegate for handling inbound IdentityPackets. PacketHandleProtocol.HandleDisconnectPacketAction The default delegate for handling inbound DisconnectPackets. PacketHandleProtocol.HandlePeerGroupPacketAction The default delegate for handling inbound peer CollectionSharePackets. PacketHandleProtocol.HandleDataTransmissionPacketAction The default delegate for handling inbound DataTransmissionPackets. PacketHandleProtocol.HandlePureMessagePacketAction The default delegate for handling inbound PureMessagePackets. These all have default implementations that can be overridden. The PeerChannel will always pass packets to the respective delegate, regardless if the OnDataReceived event is subscribed to and utilized. If you want to handle all inbound data through the OnDataReceived event, you will need to create empty filler methods that simply do not preform any actions and assign them to override the default delegates."

    "summary": "Testing This portion of documentation outlines different methods of testing, and different test types with varying levels of setup complexity. LAN Tests Quick LAN test - quickly setup a peer connection using the ExampleApplication container and a local instance started from Visual Studio Multi-peer LAN test - runs a Powershell script which automates a Docker Compose setup to simulate 3 peers establishing connection over NAT WAN Tests Bootstrap test - in progress Widescan test - in progress Quick LAN test In the ExampleApplication, startup the Docker container from Visual Studio. Once the container has verifiably started, go ahead and stop the container (Ctrl + C or from Docker dashboard) With the container still stopped, go ahead and run a regular instance of the ExampleApplication from Visual Studio (Ctrl + F5) Ensure the regular instance of the ExampleApplication starts up. Leave this open. With the regular instance running, go into your Docker dashboard and go to Containers. Proceed to startup the ExampleApplication container (simply click the Start button). Go to the Exec tab and you should see the Windows terminal open. Type ExampleApplication.exe then hit enter. You should now be able to see the application start up in the Docker container. From this point, you have two instances of the ExampleApplication running which you should be able to observe side-by-side. Observe and see if the default trust protocol shows back and forth communication between the peers. Multi-peer LAN test Open the solution in Visual Studio. It is advised to Clean Solution and then to do a fresh Build Solution. Then, proceed to run the LAN_Test.ps1 script that should be in the root directory The Docker Compose build process may take a minute or two. This is normal. The build process creates a new NAT network and 3 individual peer containers. This is automated through the Powershell script. You should then be able to observe the multi-peer LAN test output within the Developer Powershell console in Visual Studio. It will typically look something like this:"

    "summary": "Widescan \uD83D\uDCE1 The P2PNet.Widescan class library project is designed to facilitate mass IPv6 address generation and peer discovery within a peer-to-peer network. This project leverages hardware capabilities, such as GPUs, to efficiently generate vast quantities of IPv6 addresses. By utilizing user-defined address prefixes, it allows for a more targeted and narrow scope of addresses to ping, enhancing the efficiency of the discovery process. This can be leveraged with publicly available information on IPv6 prefix registrations, like the Ripe database, in order to refine the scope of the widescan. Additionally, the project employs lightweight ICMP packets to broadcast discovery information, ensuring minimal network overhead while effectively communicating with potential peers. Initialization The P2PNet.Widescan project initializes by setting up the necessary configurations and services required for widescan operations. The main entry point is the Widescan class, which configures the application and starts the widescan process. Configuration: The application reads configuration settings from the provided parameters. This includes settings for address prefixes, hardware mode (GPU or CPU), and other essential configurations. Logging: Logging is configured to use a plain text format and is activated to capture important events and errors. Hardware Mode Setup: The application can be configured to use either GPU offloading or parallel CPU capabilities for address generation and peer discovery. Operation The P2PNet.Widescan project operates by providing several key functionalities: IPv6 Address Generation: The widescan application generates vast quantities of IPv6 addresses using either GPU offloading or parallel CPU capabilities. This allows for efficient and rapid address generation. GPU Offloading: Utilizes the processing power of GPUs to generate IPv6 addresses in parallel, significantly speeding up the process. Parallel CPU Capabilities: Uses multiple CPU cores to generate IPv6 addresses in parallel, providing an alternative for systems without GPU support. Peer Discovery: The widescan application pings the generated IPv6 addresses to discover potential peers within the network. It uses lightweight ICMP packets to broadcast discovery information, ensuring minimal network overhead. Address Prefix Filtering: By utilizing user-defined address prefixes, the widescan application narrows the scope of addresses to ping, enhancing the efficiency of the discovery process. This can be refined using publicly available information on IPv6 prefix registrations, such as the Ripe database. Integration The P2PNet.Widescan project is designed to be a modular import that can be integrated with other P2P network applications, such as aP2PNetwork client application or the P2PBootstrap server. It does not run independently and does not use appsettings.json for configuration. Instead, it relies on the host application to provide the necessary configuration parameters. Diagrams To supplement the information visually, the following diagrams are provided: Widescan Architecture: Shows the overall architecture of the widescan application, including its interaction with the P2P network and the hardware components (GPU/CPU). IPv6 Address Generation Flow: Illustrates the flow of IPv6 address generation, from configuration to address generation using GPU or CPU, and finally to peer discovery. This is very much a simple consumer-producer pattern, with intermediate in-memory queues to operate as a broadcaster. ICMP Packet Listener: Operating independently of the broadcaster, the ICMP Packet Listener operates as a listener for responses from prospective peers and other potential widescan instances. This utilizes a docile form of packet sniffing on the host machine. Note: Widescan project still under construction \uD83C\uDFD7️"
